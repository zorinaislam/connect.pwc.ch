Tesla delivered 10 to 12 Cyber Trucks to customers for the first time on November 30. And so many car lovers are interested to know the various technical aspects of this electric-powered pickup. However, within a month and a half of entering the market, errors were found in the design and signal control of the Cyber Truck. A person named &#8216;Nan&#8217; identified these errors in the cyber truck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After driving for about 80 km, Nan noticed these defects of the cyber truck. He said that some of the panels on the exterior of the Cyber Truck on the side of the truck bed have positional anomalies. Apart from this, the right side signal control of the vehicle is also defective. Despite these defects, he expressed his satisfaction with the steering and acceleration of the Cyber Truck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made of stainless steel, the Cyber Truck has a 6-feet long and 4-feet wide space for transporting goods. The car can carry 25 thousand pounds. Apart from this, the towing capacity of the car is 11 thousand pounds. Due to the stainless steel body, the car does not stain or scratch, so painting is not required. More than two million people have already registered to buy the Tesla-made Cyber Truck. Depending on the model and version, the price of Cyber Truck is 60 thousand 990, 79 thousand 990 and 99 thousand 990 US dollars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that on December 28, a cyber truck was involved in an accident on Skyline Boulevard in Palo Alto, California, USA. At that time, the cyber truck collided with a Toyota Corolla car. While the Toyota car was damaged in the accident, the Cyber truck was not damaged.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a lot of curiosity in the technology world about the cyber truck made by Tesla, an electric car manufacturer owned by Elon Musk.
