This time he himself, the audience was also laughing after giving birth to a surprise in the second round of women&#8217;s singles. The 16-year-old schoolgirl from Russia lost to her ideal Tunisian Uns Jabir, who is seeded sixth in the tournament. That too in a 6-0, 6-2 game in less than an hour. This is Andreeva&#8217;s first win against someone ranked in the top 10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the win Andriva said about playing without pressure, &#8216;I was really nervous before the match, but I saw he was nervous too. It helped me, because I realized I&#8217;m not the only one nervous before a match. I just wanted to enjoy, because it&#8217;s Rod Laver Arena, playing against someone I love. I just wanted to play and I think I played well.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is only Andreeva&#8217;s second match on Center Court in Melbourne. She lost to compatriot Alina Korniva in the girls&#8217; final last year. Andreeva, who was &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; with the loss, says that the match helped her to move forward. After the match, he said, &#8220;Today when I saw that I will play Rod Laver, I said to myself &#8211; this time I have to take a chance.&#8221; Must win first time on big court. I won.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andriva also says that this is the best match in his career, &#8216;I did not expect to play so well in the first set. The second set wasn&#8217;t bad either. Yes, it was a great match for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreeva will face France&#8217;s Diane Parry in the next round. However, this is not the first Grand Slam for him. Last year, he reached the third round at the French Open and the fourth round at Wimbledon after getting past the qualifiers. However, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Coco Goff at the US Open. Andreeva dreams of a tennis career, but she also has to deal with school. He said, &#8216;I have to do a lot at school. In fact, it started two days ago, so I have to go. Then he added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like chemistry.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreeva is so young, how many tournaments she can play in, that has also been fixed by the WTA. Andriva, who is now number 47, doesn&#8217;t want to think about how much she can go up in the ranking, &#8216;I mean, I am 16 now. Why should you think about ranking? I am climbing higher and my goal is to climb higher. Maybe a little, but high. I don&#8217;t know exactly. I try not to think about these things. I want to think only about tennis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jabir was defeated by Andreeva today in just 20 minutes. The 29-year-old Jabir from Tunisia was not in the rhythm at all today. Scored just eight points in six games, including just three from the baseline. The runner-up in three Grand Slams made 10 unforced errors today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrivar&#8217;s victory today at the Australian Open is not the only &#8216;Russian-shock&#8217;. 2018 champion Caroline Wozniacki lost to 20-year-old Maria Timofeva of Russia. After losing the first set 6-1, Timofeva came back in style, winning the next two sets 6-4, 6-1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timofeva said after the match, &#8220;It was an honor to play here today against Caroline.&#8221; I can&#8217;t express how happy I am, I could ask for more than that.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timofeva&#8217;s opponent in the next round is tenth seed Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;It seems that I am more mature now than before.&#8221;&#8220;You&#8217;re only 16.&#8221;&#8216;Yes, but last year there were 15.&#8217; Rod Laver Arena laughed at Mira Andreeva&#8217;s conversation with the referee after the match.
