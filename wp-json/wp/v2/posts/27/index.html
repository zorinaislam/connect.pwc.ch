Nadal will visit Saudi every year as an ambassador. Besides helping the development of tennis, he will also monitor the progress of the academy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After becoming the ambassador of the Saudi Tennis Federation yesterday, Nadal said, &#8216;I want this game to spread globally. Saudi Arabia is a really promising country in this field. Australian Open winner Caroline Wozniacki also believes that there is an opportunity for positive changes in the country&#8217;s tennis through the hands of star tennis players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wozniacki returned to the Australian Open after 4 years due to the birth of two children and maternity responsibilities. The 33-year-old Danish tennis star&#8217;s return has not been pleasant. Today the young Russian lost to Maria Timofeeva and was eliminated from the second round.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the press conference after the match, Wozniacki said about Nadal being the ambassador of Saudi tennis, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t read much about Rafa (Nadal), what he is actually doing. But clearly he is asserting his strong position in Saudi sports. First golf and football and now tennis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wozniacki believes that Saudi Arabia is developing a strong position in sports, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s inevitable, it&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221; When that happens, there is an opportunity for us to make a difference and do something good.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developed world has been vocal about human rights violations in Saudi Arabia for a long time. Critics believe that in order to improve its image in the international arena, Saudi Arabia must stop its anti-humanitarian activities. This attempt to use sports to increase Saudi&#8217;s international reputation is nothing more than &#8216;sports washing&#8217; in the eyes of critics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Wozniacki believes that positive changes will be made in Saudi sports by the hand of star players, &#8220;I understand human rights and other issues. But I think with the amount of money they (Saudi Arabia) are pouring into sports, it&#8217;s inevitable. We have an opportunity to change (the perception of Saudi) by doing something good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Saudi Tennis Federation hosted the Next Gen ATP Finals in Jeddah last November-December. In addition, there were two exhibition matches between Novak Djokovic-Carlos Alcaraz and Ariana Sabalenka-Unus Jabir. It is heard that Saudi will also host the WTI Finals this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the matter is not so clear for Iga Seontek, who is at the top of the women&#8217;s tennis rankings. The 22-year-old Polish star said, &#8216;The WTA Finals are going to be in Saudi &#8211; I&#8217;ve heard a lot of rumours. We are still waiting for the decision. Whether it&#8217;s good or not, it&#8217;s always hard for me to say. Because, in that area (Arab world) it is not easy for girls to play sports. But it is true that those countries want to progress politically and socially.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rafael Nadal has become the ambassador of the country&#8217;s tennis federation as part of the special importance given to sports in Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#8217;s &#8216;Vision 2030&#8217; reform project.
